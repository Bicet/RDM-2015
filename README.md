# RDM-2015
Easily set Mac Retina display to higher unsupported resolutions.

This is a tool that lets you use MacBook Pro Retina's highest and unsupported resolutions.
As an example, a Retina MacBook Pro 15" can be set to 3840×2400 maximum resolution, as
opposed to Apple's max supported 1920×1050. It is accessible from the menu bar.

This software was studied and released [here](http://garethjenkins.com/2012/07/01/investigating-a-high-resolution-retina-utility-for-macbook-pro-1x-and-2x-modes/#comment-623)
and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/vi9yf/set_your_retina_macbook_pros_resolution_to/)
by its original authors. I just improved the build system and Makefile, fixed the icon,
added support for easy installable package (PKG, DMG) and improved the way menu is
displayed.

 I don't know what is the license by its authors because it came 100%
uncommented and undocumented. But I'm sure they would enjoy you to freely use it. Me too.
